Abstract
========

Provides a short description of the purpose of the feature and the functionality
it will deliver, including the reasons why it is desirable.

Specification
=============

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.
The specification should be detailed enough to allow implementation -- that is,
developers other than the author should (given the right experience) be able to
independently implement the feature, given only the WEP.

Include subheadings as necessary.
