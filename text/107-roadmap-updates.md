## Proposed roadmap items for Wagtail 7.1\* (August 2025)

### [Google Summer of Code 2025](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/97)

Exact items TBC. Showcasing our participation to [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) on the project roadmap.

### [Site settings permissions](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/95)

A new permission model for sites, where groups can be assigned permissions at the level of individual sites. This better maps organisational structures, compared to the current model of permissions being assigned at the level of the settings model rather than instances.

For more information, see [RFC 105: Site settings permissions](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/105).

### [Headless userbar](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/100)

Adding built-in support for the Wagtail userbar in headless mode, including accessibility checks, based on built-in preview support.
