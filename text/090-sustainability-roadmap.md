# RFC 090: Sustainability roadmap

- RFC: 090
- Author: Thibaud Colas
- Created: 2023-11-27
- Last Modified: 2023-11-27

## Abstract

Wagtail’s carbon footprint is on the order of thousands of tons of CO2-equivalent per year.
With Wagtail now having a [sustainability statement](https://wagtail.org/sustainability/) and the start of [documentation for sites to reduce emissions](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/sustainability_considerations.html#sustainability-considerations), we need a clearer roadmap to reduce the carbon footprint of Wagtail websites and Wagtail as a whole.

Creating this roadmap as an RFC will allow for community feedback, help contributors be aware of this effort as early as possible, and encourage collaboration.

To help with planning, we track possible improvements across three themes:

1. Measure the carbon footprint of Wagtail
2. Reduce the carbon footprint of Wagtail
3. Spread the word

With Wagtail being open source self-hosted software, the impact of this effort will be entirely dependent on the adoption of the improvements by Wagtail site implementers.

## Key measures

With a lot of room for climate change efforts to be data-driven, we propose the following key metrics to assess the impact of possible efforts across the three areas outlined above.

### Carbon footprint of Wagtail

As tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year (tCO2e/year).

This is the total amount of carbon emissions generated by Wagtail as an open source organization and the websites using Wagtail.
It includes the emissions of Wagtail project infrastructure, maintainers, contributors, and users.
It includes the emissions of Wagtail websites, to the extent that they can be determined with publicly-available data.

This figure should be reported in accordance with the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG)](https://ghgprotocol.org/).
In particular, it should include all Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions.

### Scoring of Wagtail websites on Web Sustainability Guidelines audits

As a median, average, or other measure of the statistical distribution of scores of Wagtail websites.

The score would be a yet-to-be implemented measurement of how well a website conforms with the [Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/).
At its most basic, it could be a count of how many WSG success criteria are "passed". 3. **Number of Wagtail websites with a Net Zero target**.

The WSG aren’t well established yet, so this would require a lot of R&D work, and collaboration with the community group behind the guidelines.

### Number of Wagtail websites with a Net Zero target

As an absolute count of how many websites have such targets.

Websites with specific climate commitments would count whether the targets are present due to the websites’ local legal landscape, or a commitment of the website owner’s organization, or a specific goal at the level of the individual website.

## Possible improvements

### Measure the carbon footprint of Wagtail

**Ideal outcome**: A community-wide understanding of how Wagtail websites and community efforts contribute to climate change. Methodologies we can confidently use to assess the impact of future work.

Here are specific improvements within this area:

- Create a methodology to measure the carbon footprint of Wagtail websites
- Measure the carbon footprint of building Wagtail:
  - Wagtail project infrastructure
  - Wagtail events
  - Wagtail maintainers and contributors
- Establish a methodology to collect data about how many Wagtail websites there are and their characteristics
- Document a methodology to extrapolate the carbon footprint of all Wagtail websites from publicly-available data
- Create a methodology to measure the footprint of specific features
- Define more granular carbon footprint KPIs that could be referenced on a regular basis

### Reduce the carbon footprint of Wagtail

**Ideal outcome**: a lower carbon footprint for Wagtail websites and Wagtail as a whole.

Here are specific improvements as a _first draft_. This is missing:

- Highlights on which improvements are the most promising.
- A notion of status – some of those improvements have already happened.
- More improvements from more recent auditing of accessibility guidelines.
- A sense of how granular this should get vs. agreement on high-level principles.

Explanation of the columns:

- **Scope clarity**: how well-defined is the improvement? Is it clear what the improvement is, and how it would be implemented?
- **Impact**: how much of an impact would this improvement have on the carbon footprint of Wagtail websites?
- **Reach**: how many Wagtail websites would this improvement affect (given the sites were to upgrade to the relevant version)?
- **Complexity**: how complex would this improvement be to implement?
- **Measures**: what measures would we use to assess the impact of this improvement?

### Spread the word

**Ideal outcome**: Buy-in from Wagtail users and wider industry on the importance of sustainability, and the role of Wagtail in this.

Here are specific improvements within this area:

- Refine Wagtail’s current sustainability statement, and make it more visible
- Organise sustainability-themed Wagtail events
  - Sustainability sprint
  - What’s New in Wagtail – sustainability edition
  - Sustainability-themed Wagtail Space
- Create a sustainability team for Wagtail
- Publish case studies on tackling sustainability-related requirements on Wagtail projects
- Write a yearly sustainability report for Wagtail
- Improve the documentation’s "Sustainability considerations" page
- Rate possible [Wagtail hosting providers](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Wagtail-Hosting-Providers) on sustainability considerations

## Supporting activities

Here are possible activities which we could take on to adjust this roadmap / support the delivery of the improvements outlined above.

- Creation of a sustainability team for Wagtail
- Upskill of Wagtail contributors via [Green Software for Practitioners course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/)
- Review of [Green Software Patterns](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/) relevance for Wagtail & Wagtail websites
- Review of [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) relevance for authoring tools: [Authoring Tool Guidance sustyweb#22](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/22)
- Audit Wagtail websites with [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/)
- Review Wagtail on [Green Software Maturity Matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wa2lliXQeH6HE1JHqwjTFuVndRUXzxGlbYXRtTQxF5o/edit)

## Open questions

### Should the Wagtail project have a Net Zero target or other formal climate commitment?

This would be unprecedented.
Net Zero commitments such as the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement), [Race to Zero](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign) or the [SBTi Corporate Net-Zero Standard](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/net-zero) aren't designed for open source projects.
They’re great ways to drive ambitious climate action nonetheless.

### Should the Wagtail project follow Web Sustainability Guidelines?

The [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) are a set of guidelines to help organizations reduce the environmental impact of their websites.
They are currently authored by a _Community Group_ at W3C, and as such don’t have the authoritativeness of web standards.
They’re still in draft, and not (yet) widely adopted.
