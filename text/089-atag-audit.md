## Abstract

This RFC is an audit report of Wagtail 6.3 for conformance with the [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/). This standard outlines requirements for content management systems like Wagtail, along two main areas:

1. [Making the authoring tool user interface accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#part_a)
2. [Supporting the production of accessible content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#part_b)

This audit report is created as an RFC for multiple reasons:

- Ease of reviewing and critiquing of specific findings from the audit, by all members of our community as relevant.
- Validation and acceptance of the auditâ€™s findings by Wagtailâ€™s core team.
- Validation and acceptance of recommended actions in particular.

Validating the auditâ€™s results will help make sure the findings as part of upcoming roadmap items:

- [Admin accessibility improvements #71](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/71)

##### A.1.2.1 Accessibility Guidelines

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.1.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a121).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail is a web-based CMS.

##### A.1.2.2 Platform Accessibility Services

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.1.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a122).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail is a web-based CMS.

##### A.2.1.1 Text Alternatives for Rendered Non-Text Content

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.2.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a211).

**Fail**. For icons within the CMS, all have appropriate alt text. For CMS-managed images, Wagtail renders non-text content in nine scenarios, five of which are related to editing views and would require changes:

- Fail: Image upload fields in the image edit/create form. The imageâ€™s title displays as a field next to the visuals. The title acts as alt text by default in Wagtail. This is missing a programmatic association between the title or description text, and the image.
  - Example: [Editing image Boston Cream Pie](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/images/43/)
  - Current: The alt text is permanently set to the contents of the Title field on page load.
  - Proposed actions:
    - The image could be more clearly associated with the live title and description fields with an `aria-labelledby`.
    - The description field could have help text to clarify its use as the imageâ€™s alt text (at least in the CMS).
- Fail: Image chooser fields in forms. The selected imageâ€™s title displays next to the visuals. The description acts as alt text by default in Wagtail. This is missing a programmatic association between the title text and image.
  - Example: [Editing Blog Page: Desserts with Benefits, Image field](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/#panel-child-content-image-section)
  - Current: Alt text set to `alt=""`, with title displayed after the image.
  - Proposed actions:
    - Associate the visible text with the image with `aria-labelledby`.
    - Switch to the description field as alt text in the CMS.
- Fail: Image chooser fields with a custom alt text field next to them. The custom alt text field is not programmatically associated with the image.
  - Example (with Caption field): [Editing Blog Page: Desserts with Benefits, Image block](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/#block-556e76b0-0f5a-42bb-b039-653f3d6b1f0b-section)
  - Alt text set to `alt=""`, with title displayed after the image, and custom field further down.
  - Proposed actions:
    - Implement this pattern in the bakerydemo website, based on the built-in ImageBlock.
    - Associate both the title of the image, and the custom field, with `aria-labelledby`, or a combination of it and `aria-describedby`.
- Fail: Images within rich text fields. Here the imageâ€™s title is displayed in a tooltip associated with the image, but there is no programmatic association.
  - Example: unavailable
  - Proposed actions:
    - Add demo content following this pattern in bakerydemo.
    - Add a programmatic association between tooltip text and image with `aria-labelledby`.
    - Make sure the image has alt text accessible even when the tooltip is closed.
- Fail: Embeds within rich text fields. Here we display the embedâ€™s thumbnail if there is one. The embedâ€™s title is displayed in a tooltip associated with the embed, but there is no programmatic association.
  - Example: [Editing Blog Page: Desserts with Benefits, Paragraph block](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/#block-ac48af95-b3be-4602-8c2f-5c43fc080f17-section)
  - Current: Alt text set to `alt=""`, with no text displayed near the image.
  - Proposed actions:
    - Add a programmatic association between tooltip text and image with `aria-labelledby`.
    - Make sure the thumbnail image has alt text accessible even when the tooltip is closed.

Outside editing views (possibly not part of ATAG requirements), Wagtail renders images in the following scenarios:

- Revisions comparison with images. The imageâ€™s title is used as alt text. The title should be visible to the user in the UI, but it is not.
  - Example: [Comparing Bread and Circuses](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/68/revisions/compare/46...108/)
  - Current: the image title is used as `alt` attribute.
  - Proposed actions:
    - Add demo content following this pattern in bakerydemo.
    - Display the imagesâ€™ titles in the UI, with programmatic `aria-labelledby` associations.
    - Switch to the `description` field as alt text.
- Revisions comparison with images or embeds in rich text: currently unimplemented.
- Snippets listings. When there is an image column, its alt text is set but invisible in the UI.
  - Example: [Snippets People](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/snippets/base/person/)
  - Current: the image title is used as `alt` attribute.
  - Proposed actions:
    - Display the imagesâ€™ titles in the UI, with programmatic `aria-labelledby` associations.
    - Switch to the `description` field as alt text.
- Image gallery. Here we display the title underneath the image as alt text, in a `figcaption`.
  - Example: [Images](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/images/)
  - Current: Alt text set to `alt=""`, but the image is within a `figure` with the imageâ€™s title as `figcaption`.
  - Proposed actions:
    - Associate the text and the image with `aria-labelledby`.
    - Switch to the `description` field as alt text.

Recommendation for Wagtail: Consider how best to sign-post the Description field as the imageâ€™s alt text in the CMS, and potentially also in the frontend (with clear options to mark images as decorative or define alt text in context).

Reference: [RFC 97: Alt Text Capabilities](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/97).

##### A.2.1.2 Alternatives for Rendered Time-Based Media

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.2.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a212).

**Fail**. Wagtailâ€™s only time-based media is animated GIFs. Their text alternatives work identically to other images in Wagtail, with the same characteristics listed in SC A.2.1.1.

#### [A.2.2. (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that editing-view presentation can be programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a22)

See [Implementing A.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a22).

##### A.2.2.1 Editing-View Status Indicators

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.2.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a221).

**Fail**. Wagtail uses the following status indicators in editing views:

- Fail: Comments on fields. Comments are displayed as a "speech bubble" icon next to the field they are associated with. The association isnâ€™t programmatically exposed. Even visually, the presence of a comment can only be identified on hover/focus within the fieldâ€™s area.
  - Example: [Editing Home Page: Welcome to the Wagtail bakery!](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/60/edit/)
  - Proposed actions:
    - Add a programmatic association between fields and their comment presence indicator
    - Make the comment presence indicator visible at all times, either for all users or users of "prefers contrast" theming.
    - (WCAG issue) Make the comment addition buttons visible at all times in commenting mode.
- Fail: Comments in rich text. Comments are displayed as highlighted text within the rich text field. The association isnâ€™t programmatically exposed.
  - Example: none available
  - Proposed actions:
    - Add demo content following this pattern in bakerydemo.
    - Research how other WYSIWYG interfaces programmatically associate comments with runs of text.
- Pass: Character count for rich text fields. The character count is displayed as a number next to the field it is associated with. The association is programmatically exposed with `aria-describedby` ("Character count: 18/120").
  - Example [Editing Recipe page: Southern Cornbread, Preface field](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/82/edit/#panel-child-content-preface-section)
- Pass: Concurrent editing notifications. The notification status is associated with a `aria-label` and tooltip on the status button.
- TBC (work in progress): content quality checks within page editor.

Outside editing views (possibly not part of ATAG requirements), Wagtail renders status indicators in the following scenarios:

- Accessibility checks in Wagtail userbar. They are currently not programmatically associated with the content they are for.

##### A.2.2.2 Access to Rendered Text Properties

> (Level AA). See [Implementing A.2.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a222).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t allow editing of any text properties associated with the content.

### [A.3. Editing-views are operable](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a3)

#### [A.3.1. (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide keyboard access to authoring features](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a31)

See [Implementing A.3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a31).

##### A.3.1.1 Keyboard Access (Minimum)

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a311).

**Fail**. Though the majority of the authoring toolâ€™s functionality is keyboard accessible, there are specific areas that arenâ€™t:

- In rich text fields, pin/unpin of the rich text toolbar.
  - Example: [Editing Blog Page: Tracking Wild Yeast](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/62/edit/)
  - Proposed actions:
    - Research how other WYSIWYG interfaces allow keyboard interactions with all toolbar controls.
- In rich text fields, Edit functionality for links, documents, images, embeds.
  - Examples:
    - Links: [Editing Standard page: About](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/76/edit/#panel-child-content-body-section)
    - Documents: [Editing Recipe page: Southern Cornbread](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/82/edit/#block-910c5024-a47a-45b1-a3a3-8f8bb5a8fa70-section)
    - Images: no example
    - Embeds: [Editing Blog page: Desserts with Benefits](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/77/edit/)
  - Proposed actions:
    - Research how other WYSIWYG interfaces allow keyboard interactions with all toolbar controls.
    - Possibly support selection of all those content types and press "Enter" to move focus to their UI.
    - See [Rich text ctrl + K keyboard shortcut should open the link or document tooltip #11627](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/11627)

    - Pages: [Editing workflow Moderator approval](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/workflows/edit/1/#workflow-pages-section)
    - Tasks: [Editing workflow Moderator approval](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/workflows/edit/1/#inline_child_workflow_tasks-0-panel-section)
  - Proposed actions:
    - Complete [Re-implement chooser modals with new design #9246](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/9246)
- In image create/edit forms, creation or editing of a focal area.
  - Current: itâ€™s impossible to set a focal area without a mouse.
  - Example: [Editing Boston Cream Pie](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/images/43/)
  - Proposed actions:
    - Add keyboard support with a new implementation
    - Factor in [possible requirements](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10947#issuecomment-1746464044) for other types of image manipulation.
- In table blocks, editing of the table.
  - Example: [Editing Recipe page: Hot Cross Bun](https://static-wagtail-v6-3.netlify.app/admin/pages/81/edit/#block-2b9b59cb-4dd7-4ebf-ac66-1ed43471609b-section)

##### A.3.1.2 No Keyboard Traps

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a312).

**Pass**. There are no known keyboard traps in the administrative interface.

##### A.3.1.3 Efficient Keyboard Access

> (Level AA). See [Implementing A.3.1.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a313).

**Pass**. The administrative interface provides the following mechanisms to improve keyboard navigation:

- A skip link, across all views, to skip the sidebar.
- Collapsible sections on long views to avoid having to tab through all of the content.
- A mechanism to link to specific collapsible sections, for direct access via bookmarks.
- A "Collapse/expand all sections" button on long forms to navigate more easily to a specific section.
- The "minimap" skip-menu on long forms to navigate more easily to a specific section.

##### A.3.1.4 Keyboard Access (Enhanced)

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.3.1.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a314).

**Fail**. See _A.3.1.1 Keyboard Access_. We would expect addressing all aspects listed in _A.3.1.1_ to also address this criterion.

##### A.3.1.5 Customize Keyboard Access

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.3.1.5](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a315).

**Fail**. None of Wagtailâ€™s keyboard commands can be customized.

Proposed actions:

- Implement a "key map" for Wagtailâ€™s keyboard commands and-or command palette, with a way to upload a new key map as JSON.

##### A.3.1.6 Present Keyboard Commands

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.3.1.6](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a316).

**Pass**. Across specific areas:

- Pass: In rich text fields, Markdown keyboard commands or keyboard shortcuts are displayed within tooltips for specific toolbar buttons.
- Pass: In rich text fields, "command palette" commands are displayed in the block chooser, and the command palette trigger is displayed in the fieldsâ€™ placeholder.
- Pass: Wagtailâ€™s other traditional "key combinations" keyboard shortcuts are displayed in the "Keyboard shortcuts" dialog. This includes:
  - Save draft
  - Preview

Proposed actions:

- View possible improvements in [Keyboard shortcut documentation for editor in the Wagtail UI #12050](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/12050)
- Consider a "Command palette" concept for Wagtail

#### [A.3.2. (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide authors with enough time](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a32)

See [Implementing A.3.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a32).

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a321).

**Fail**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t provide auto-save functionality. For Wagtail sites, the default session time limit is 2 weeks. See [Autosave #24](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/24) on the Wagtail roadmap.

##### A.3.2.2 Timing Adjustable

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a322).

**Pass**. For Wagtail sites, the default session time limit is 2 weeks.

##### A.3.2.3 Static Input Components

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.2.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a323).

**Pass**. There are no moving input components in the CMS.

##### A.3.2.4 Content Edits Saved (Extended)

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.3.2.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a324).

**Fail**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t provide auto-save functionality. See _A.3.2.1 Auto-Save (Minimum)_. We expect the same approach to be followed for both SCs.

#### [A.3.3. (For the authoring tool user interface) Help authors avoid flashing that could cause seizures](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a33)

See [Implementing A.3.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a33).

##### A.3.3.1 Static View Option

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a331).

**Fail**. Animated GIFs auto-play when rendered, with no option to pause them.

Proposed actions:

- Research accessibility best practices on animated GIFs
- Design a new interface for how CMS users interact with animated GIFs
- Implement the new interface according to ATAG, WCAG standards, and accessibility best practices.

#### [A.3.4. (For the authoring tool user interface) Enhance navigation and editing via content structure](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a34)

See [Implementing A.3.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a34).

##### A.3.4.1 Navigate By Structure

> (Level AA). See [Implementing A.3.4.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a341).

**Not applicable**. Markup elements arenâ€™t exposed in the CMS.

##### A.3.4.2 Navigate by Programmatic Relationships

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.3.4.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a342).

**Pass**. The only editable programmatic relationships are headings and element nesting in rich text fields, which can be navigated via the keyboard.

#### [A.3.5. (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide text search of the content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a35)

See [Implementing A.3.5](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a35).

##### A.3.5.1 Text Search

> (Level AA). See [Implementing A.3.5.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a351).

**Fail**. Wagtail supports browsersâ€™ built-in text search which meets all criteria, but only allows searching within the currently-active tab of the editing view. For example, for pages, content under the "Promote" tab will only be searchable when this tab is active.

Proposed actions:

- Implement [hidden="until-found"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden).
- Research how other content management systems cater for this requirement.
- Fix [Activating a tab based on the URL hash should also set focus to the corresponding tabpanel #8483](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/8483)

#### [A.3.6. (For the authoring tool user interface) Manage preference settings](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a36)

See [Implementing A.3.6](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a36).

##### A.3.6.1 Independence of Display

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.6.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a361).

**Pass**. All of Wagtailâ€™s UI settings can be adjusted without modifying the content.

##### A.3.6.2 Save Settings

> (Level AA). See [Implementing A.3.6.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a362).

**Pass**. Specific settings are saved differently. The following settings are persistent for a given user profile, across all sessions of said user:

- Language
- Time zone
- Notification settings
- Admin interface theme
- UI density
- Contrast theme

The following settings are persistent for a given browser, across all sessions within said browser:

- Sidebar expanded/collapsed
- Rich text toolbar pinned/unpinned
- Minimap opened/closed
- Currently-open side panel

##### A.3.6.3 Apply Platform Settings

> (Level AA). See [Implementing A.3.6.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a363).

**Pass**. Wagtailâ€™s language, time zone, and theme settings default to respecting platform settings until set to a specific value by the user.

#### [A.3.7. (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a37)

See [Implementing A.3.7](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_a37).

##### A.3.7.1 Preview (Minimum)

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.3.7.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a371).

**Pass**. Wagtailâ€™s live preview for pages and snippets and its draft renders within the userâ€™s browser.

##### A.3.7.2 Preview (Enhanced)

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.3.7.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a372).

**Pass**. Wagtailâ€™s live preview for pages and snippets can only display within the userâ€™s browser, but all saved draft content can be previewed in any browser/device the user is logged in.

### [A.4. Editing-views are understandable](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_a4)

#### [A.4.1. (For the authoring tool user interface) Help authors avoid and correct mistakes](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a41)

##### A.4.1.1 Content Changes Reversible (Minimum)

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.4.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a411).

**Fail**. Though a large number of authoring actions are reversible, not all are. The following actions are reversible:

- Plain text and rich text content editing within specific fields, reversible until the user submits the form.
- Editing of page or snippets content supporting revisions, reversible for the whole page/snippet at any later point in the siteâ€™s history.

The following actions are not reversible but do require confirmation to proceed:

- Permanent deletion of any content which has its own dedicated creation/editing views.
- Unpublishing of pages and snippets.
- Deletion of comments within page content.

The following actions are not reversible and do not require confirmation to proceed:

- StreamField / InlinePanel block-based content editing, reversible only as part of support for content revisions.
  - Consider implementing an in-browser undo-redo stack for those interactions.
- Image / Document / Page / Task / Snippet / Embed chooser fields, reversible only as part of support for content revisions.
  - Consider implementing an in-browser undo-redo stack for those interactions.
- Authoring actions on content that does not support revisions such as images, documents, etc.
  - Implement either a confirmation step for those actions, or revisions/versioning support.
- Reordering of pages within list views
  - Implement either a confirmation step for those actions, or revisions/versioning support.

##### A.4.1.2 Settings Change Confirmation

> (Level A). See [Implementing A.4.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a412).

**Pass**. All of Wagtailâ€™s UI settings saved at the browser level can be reversed by the user directly within the UI. All of the settings saved at the user profile level can be set to an "unset" default value.

Recommendation for Wagtail:

- Reset all browser-level settings when users intentionally log out (not on session timeouts)
- Add a way to "Reset preferences" â€“ reverse all browser-level and user profile settings to their default value within the userâ€™s profile form.

##### A.4.1.3 Content Changes Reversible (Enhanced)

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing A.4.1.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_a413).

**Pass**. Reversible plain text and rich text content changes can be reversed sequentially while the user remains on the page. Content supporting revisions can be restored at any point in the contentâ€™s history.

#### [A.4.2. (For the authoring tool user interface) Document the user interface, including all accessibility features](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_a42)

## [B. Support the production of accessible content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#part_b)

### [B.1. Fully automatic processes produce accessible content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_b1)

#### [B.1.1. Ensure that automatically-specified content is accessible](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b11)

See [Implementing B.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b11).

##### B.1.1.1 Content Auto-Generation After Authoring Sessions (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.1.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b111).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level AAA**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t automatically generate content after authoring sessions. Processes that operate after authoring sessions and could alter the content are [scheduled publishing](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/pages/theory.html#id2) and [search index](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/search/indexing.html#wagtailsearch-indexing-update) updates, but in both cases any automatically-generated content would already be present during the session.

##### B.1.1.2 Content Auto-Generation During Authoring Sessions (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.1.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b112).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. Wagtail automatically generates content in a few scenarios. In the following scenarios, markup is accessible without further work:

- Pass: Links markup for links to pages, documents, external URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and internal anchors within rich text fields.
- Pass: Embeds for external resources within rich text fields.
- Pass: Embeds for external resources in StreamField.
- Pass: Image markup for images in rich text fields. Images are rendered with alt text from an editable field, and a checkbox to mark the image as decorative.
- Pass: Image markup for images in StreamField. The Image block is rendered with alt text from an editable field, and a checkbox to mark the image as decorative.
- Pass: Table markup from TableBlock.
- Pass: Table markup for TypedTableBlock.

Proposed actions:

- Consider enforcing all editor accessibility-checks have to pass before publishing content.

#### [B.1.2. Ensure that accessibility information is preserved](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b12)

See [Implementing B.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b12).

##### B.1.2.1 Restructuring and Recoding Transformations (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.1.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b121).

**Not applicable**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. The only transformation present in Wagtail is processing of clipboard paste information in rich text fields to sanitize the content, which preserves accessibility semantics for preserved content, but isnâ€™t considered a content transformation per ATAG.

If it was considered a content transformation â€“ rich paste processing preserves all formatting supported in rich text fields. Heading levels, bullet lists, and image alt text are preserved in particular.

##### B.1.2.2 Copy-Paste Inside Authoring Tool (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.1.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b122).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. Wagtail supports copy-paste of rich text content, which is fully preserved when copy-pasting between fields configured to support the same formatting. Fields configured differently will accordingly have their formatting stripped as needed.

##### B.1.2.3 Optimizations Preserve Accessibility

> (Level A). See [Implementing B.1.2.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b123).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t perform any optimizations that would affect accessibility.

##### B.1.2.4 Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content are Preserved

> (Level A). See [Implementing B.1.2.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b124).

**Not applicable**. See _B.1.2.1 Restructuring and Recoding Transformations (WCAG)_.

### [B.2. Authors are supported in producing accessible content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_b2)

#### [B.2.1. Ensure that accessible content production is possible](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b21)

See [Implementing B.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b21).

##### B.2.1.1 Accessible Content Possible (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.2.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b211).

**Fail**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. Wagtail places extensive restrictions on the production of web content, which all nonetheless allow for the production of accessible content, with the exception of:

- Missing support for setting `lang` attributes within rich text. This could be worked around by using other types of content modeling for multilingual content, which is possible but unlikely.

Proposed actions:

- Implement [Feature request: Support for declaring language on elements in rich text. #4694](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/4694)

#### [B.2.2. Guide authors to produce accessible content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b22)

See [Implementing B.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b22).

##### B.2.2.1 Accessible Option Prominence (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.2.2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b221).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. Where text styling options are available, they are presented alongside semantic formatting options such as headings. This is for example the case in rich text formatting options.

For StreamField block formats, the order is up to each site implementer to decide on. There are no built-in formats that are automatically included.

##### B.2.2.2 Setting Accessibility Properties (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.2.2.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b222).

**Not applicable**. Evaluated as: **Level AAA**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t support setting web content attribute values. This has been discussed extensively for links, as well as an option to set `aria-label`, but hasnâ€™t been implemented yet.

See:

- [Feature request: Support for declaring language on elements in rich text. #4694](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/4694)
- [Feature: ability to set links as "nofollow" rel via the WYSIWG editor's link chooser #4474](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/4474)

#### [B.2.3. Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23)

See [Implementing B.2.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b23).

##### B.2.3.1 Alternative Content is Editable (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.2.3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b231).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. All areas where images can be used support providing alt text. This includes:

- Global alt text via the built-in "Description" field.
- Contextual alt text within rich text via the "Alt text" field and "Decorative" checkbox.
- Contextual alt text in blocks via the "Alt text" field and "Decorative" checkbox.

##### B.2.3.2 Automating Repair of Text Alternatives

> (Level A). See [Implementing B.2.3.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b232).

**Pass**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t attempt to repair text alternatives. It does use the imageâ€™s file name as the default value for the imageâ€™s title field when creating a new image, which is used for alt text, but this is part of the upload/editing process (In-Session Repairs) and not an automated process. Said file name is filtered by default to remove the file extension.

##### B.2.3.3 Save for Reuse

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing B.2.3.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b233).

**Fail**. By default, Wagtail saves each imageâ€™s text alternative and reuses it everywhere the image is reused ("Save and Suggest"). It is possible to replace this text alternative with a new one, but it isnâ€™t possible to delete it.

Suggested action: incorporate this requirement into the contextual alt text support.

#### [B.2.4. Assist authors with accessible templates](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b24)

See [Implementing B.2.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b24).

##### B.2.4.1 Accessible Template Options (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.2.4.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b241).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level AA**. With rich text formatting and StreamField blocks, Wagtail provides templates for basic text content as well as complex formatting like tables. Wagtail also provides templates for form fields within its forms module. As of now, none of those templates have accessibility issues.

###### Rich text formats

Note: Blockquote formatting does not support the optional blockquote `cite` attribute or `<cite>` element.

###### Field block types

| Template             | Accessibility issues with output |

| DocumentChooserBlock | None                             |
| ImageBlock           | None                             |
| ImageChooserBlock    | None                             |
| SnippetChooserBlock  | None                             |
| EmbedBlock           | None                             |
| TableBlock           | None                             |
| TypedTableBlock      | None                             |

Note: BlockQuoteBlock does not support the optional blockquote `cite` attribute or `<cite>` element.

###### Structural block types

Structural block types do not render any content and as such have no accessibility issues.

| Template    | Accessibility issues |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| StaticBlock | None                 |
| StructBlock | None                 |
| ListBlock   | None                 |
| StreamBlock | None                 |

###### Form builder field types

There are no issues with the latest Django 5.2. In past versions, error messages werenâ€™t [programmatically associated with the field](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32819).

| Template         | Accessibility issues            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Single line text | None |
| Multi-line text  | None |
| Email            | None |
| Number           | None |
| URL              | None |
| Checkbox         | None |
| Checkboxes       | None |
| Drop down        | None |
| Multiple select  | None |
| Radio buttons    | None |
| Date             | None |
| Date/time        | None |
| Hidden field     | None                            |

This may be addressed in the future, via improvements in Django. See:

- [Django ticket #32819 - Fieldsâ€™ help text and errors should be associated with input](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32819)
- [Fixed #32819 -- Established relationship between form fields and their errors. #17520](https://github.com/django/django/pull/17520)

Proposed actions:

- Support improvements in Django

##### B.2.4.2 Identify Template Accessibility

> (Level AA). See [Implementing B.2.4.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b242).

**Pass**. Wagtailâ€™s template selection mechanism is the block chooser (or field chooser for form builder fields). In both cases, there would be no options defined unless configured by site implementers, which can customize block icons or labels / names to indicate accessible block types.

##### B.2.4.3 Author-Created Templates

> (Level AA). See [Implementing B.2.4.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b243).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t allow authors to create custom block templates.

##### B.2.4.4 Accessible Template Options (Enhanced)

> (Level AAA). See [Implementing B.2.4.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b244).

**Pass**. All of the template options are accessible. See _B.2.4.1 Accessible Template Options_.

#### [B.2.5. Assist authors with accessible pre-authored content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b25)

See [Implementing B.2.5](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b25).

##### B.2.5.1 Accessible Pre-Authored Content Options

> (Level AA). See [Implementing B.2.5.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b251).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t provide pre-authored content.

##### B.2.5.2 Identify Pre-Authored Content Accessibility

> (Level AA). See [Implementing B.2.5.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b252).

**Not applicable**. Wagtail doesnâ€™t provide pre-authored content.

### [B.3. Authors are supported in improving the accessibility of existing content](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#principle_b3)

#### [B.3.1. Assist authors in checking for accessibility problems](https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b31)

See [Implementing B.3.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#gl_b31).

##### B.3.1.1 Checking Assistance (WCAG)

> (Level A / AA / AAA). See [Implementing B.3.1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b311).

**Pass**. Evaluated as: **Level A**. There are a number of formatting / content entry options in the CMS that can lead to accessibility issues. The built-in accessibility checker provides automated tests for a number of possible issues, but not all. Available checks are:

- `button-name`: `<button>` elements must always have a text label.
- `empty-heading`: This rule checks for headings with no text content. Empty headings are confusing to screen readers users and should be avoided.
- `empty-table-header`: Table header text should not be empty
- `frame-title`: `<iframe>` elements must always have a text label.
- `heading-order`: This rule checks for incorrect heading order. Headings should be ordered in a logical and consistent manner, with the main heading (h1) followed by subheadings (h2, h3, etc.).
- `input-button-name`: `<input>` button elements must always have a text label.
- `link-name`: `<a>` link elements must always have a text label.
- `p-as-heading`: This rule checks for paragraphs that are styled as headings. Paragraphs should not be styled as headings, as they donâ€™t help users who rely on headings to navigate content.
- `alt-text-quality`: A custom rule ensures that image alt texts donâ€™t contain anti-patterns like file extensions and underscores.

There are a number of success criteria that do not have automated checks nor instructions for manual checking:

- 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (AA) â€“Â instructions and potentially limited automated checks on correct link text (avoid "click here")
- 1.4.5 Images of Text (AA) â€“Â instructions on avoiding images of text except for scenarios where there is no alternative
- 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (AAA) â€“ see above
- 1.4.9 Images of Text (No Exception) (AAA) â€“ see above
- 3.1.5 Reading Level (AAA) â€“Â instructions for manual checking or automated checks
- 2.4.10 Section Headings (AAA) â€“ instructions for manual checking or automated checks
- 3.3.5 Help (AAA) â€“ instructions for manual checking or automated checks for the form builder

Proposed actions:

- Implement more automated checks for WCAG SCs in question. [Content quality checkers #11063](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063)
- Implement a manual check process for WCAG SCs in question. [Content quality checkers #11063](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063)
- Roadmap: [Readability checks #50](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/50)
- Content quality API integrations for text quality and image computer vision
- Improve options for organizations to embed their own instructions within the CMS, via HelpBlock and help text.

##### B.3.1.2 Help Authors Decide

> (Level A). See [Implementing B.3.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b312).

**Not applicable**. Currently all of Wagtailâ€™s automated checks are pass/fail with no author input required. Discussion on further checks: [Content quality checkers #11063](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063)

##### B.3.1.3 Help Authors Locate

> (Level A). See [Implementing B.3.1.3](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b313).

**Not applicable**. Currently all of Wagtailâ€™s automated checks are pass/fail with no author input required. Those checks do indicate which elements they are flagging. Proposed improvements:

- [Content quality checkers #11063](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063)
- [Accessibility checker in page editor #10136](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10136)
- Correct identification of Wagtail content so errors are only reported on CMS-managed content

##### B.3.1.4 Status Report

> (Level AA). See [Implementing B.3.1.4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/NOTE-IMPLEMENTING-ATAG20-20150924/#sc_b314).

**Pass**. Wagtailâ€™s accessibility checker reports on the number of detected issues, and upon interaction lists all rules that detected problems and where on the page.

Possible improvements:

- [Content quality checkers #11063](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11063) â€“ making this data available in more readily accessible reports
